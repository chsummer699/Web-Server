# tell you how to add you nginx service into system service and make the service auto-run when the system reboot
# the code below is undertest
# but the drawback is that you need to make sure the service start first ,otherwise these orders won't work!!!
# add the service into system, so we can use 'systemctl start/stop/reload nginx' to control nginx process! 

# start the service when system start 
# reference is below
$ /etc/rc.d/rc.local 


#!/bin/bash
# chkconfig: - 85 16  #it's very important
